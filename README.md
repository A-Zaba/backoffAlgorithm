## backOffAlgorthm Library

This repository contains the backoffAlgorithm library, a utility library to calculate interval period for network operation retries (like failed network connection with server) using exponential back-off with jitter algorithm. The backoffAlgorithm library is distributed under the [MIT Open Source License](LICENSE).

This library supports the "Full Jitter" algorithm for exponential back-off with jitter.
More information about the algorithm can be seen in the [Exponential Backoff and Jitter](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/) AWS blog.
